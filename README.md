SMSChat
============

A distributed chat application wich allows users to set a node of a distributed chat network over SMS protocol.
Users without the application can chat too! The protocol is human readable and allows human interaction.
In the event of connection between two apps users on a similar room (same room name) each app becomes a bridge and a distributed network emerges

## Status ##
Still in early stages API is not over and UI is just imported form a previous project.
I'll update here when the application becomes testable.
